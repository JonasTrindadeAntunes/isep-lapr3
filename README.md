1. Integrative Project

In this project, students should be able to analyze, design, and implement a software solution that supports the management of a company responsible for running an agricultural 
facility using organic production methods (OPM). This project serves as a proof-of-concept and covers a set of critical aspects in managing an organic farm, namely: 
management of plots (fields), crops, irrigation, marketing of agricultural products through networks, management of information collected from weather sensors, and sizing and use of agricultural warehouses requiring controlled temperatures.

Following the best practices learned during the course, particularly in the subjects of Computer Architecture (ARQCP), Databases (BDDAD), Information Structures (ESINF), Applied Physics (FSIAP),
and Project Laboratory III (LAPR3), an iterative and incremental development process will be used. Therefore, an Agile methodology based on SCRUM should be employed to manage team work in four-week sprints.

The solution to be developed should consist of three applications implemented in PL/SQL, Java, and C/Assembly, respectively. 
To increase maintainability and adhere to software development best practices, implementation should follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

2. Problem Description

This section describes the problem to be solved and the development of a software solution addressing some of the critical aspects of operating an organic farm.
It introduces organic farming and its specificities, characterizes a farm and its components - including irrigation systems
and agricultural weather stations - and presents the most common marketing models in this type of farming.
